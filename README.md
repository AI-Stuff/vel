Deep learning utility repository - pytorch version

My goal is to establish a Rails-like convention-over-configuration opionated set of tools streamlining research and development of deep learning models.

## TODO:

- [x] Metric/aggregation API
- [x] Training progress pretty print
- [x] Integrate loss/metrics with a model
- [x] CIFAR 10 dataset and models
- [x] CIFAR 10 Resnet models
- [x] Refine source API
- [x] Augmentation visualization
- [x] Learning rate scheduling
- [x] Augmentations and input transformation pipeline
- [x] CIFAR 10 state of the art
- [x] Database storage of experiment results
- [x] Model checkpointing
- [x] Visdom integration
- [ ] Learning rate finder
- [ ] SGD with warm restarts
- [ ] "Phase" training
- [ ] Super-convergence experiments
- [ ] Cats vs dogs transfer learning
