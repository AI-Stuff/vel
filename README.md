Deep learning utility repository - pytorch version

My goal is to establish a Rails-like convention-over-configuration opionated set of tools streamlining research and development of deep learning models.

## TODO:

- [x] Metric/aggregation API
- [x] Training progress pretty print
- [x] Integrate loss/metrics with a model
- [ ] Refine source API
- [ ] CIFAR 10 dataset and models
- [ ] Learning rate scheduling
- [ ] Database storage of experiment results
- [ ] Model checkpointing
- [ ] Augmentations and input transformation pipeline
